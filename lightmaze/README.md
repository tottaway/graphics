# LightMaze - 2D Platformer Puzzle Game

## Game Overview

LightMaze is a 2D side-scrolling platformer puzzle game featuring innovative lighting-based mechanics. Players control a character who can emit different colored lights, which fundamentally changes how they interact with the game world. Objects only provide collision when they appear different from the background under the current light color, creating unique puzzle opportunities.

## Core Mechanics

### Lighting System
- **Dynamic Light Source**: Player emits a circular light that can change colors
- **Color-Based Collision**: Objects only collide with the player when they appear visually distinct from the background under current lighting
- **Example**: Red wall on white background becomes invisible (non-solid) under pure red light, allowing passage

### Metroidvania Progression
- **Color Collection**: Discover new light colors throughout the world
- **Area Unlocking**: New colors grant access to previously inaccessible regions
- **Non-linear Exploration**: Interconnected world with optional paths and secrets

### Platformer Physics
- **Gravity System**: Standard downward gravity affects player movement
- **Jump Mechanics**: Variable height jumping with momentum conservation
- **Platform Navigation**: Traditional side-scrolling movement with precise collision detection

## Technical Architecture

### Reusable Components (from existing engine)
The following components from the main engine will be reused:

**Core Framework:**
- `model::GameState` - Entity lifecycle and event management
